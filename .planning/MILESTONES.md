# Milestones

## v0.2 Production-Credible Core (Shipped: 2026-04-28)

**Phases completed:** 5 phases, 29 plans, 41 tasks

**Key accomplishments:**

- Replace dead workflow_run-with-head_branch gate with on: release: types: [published] across both publish workflows, and add mix hex.info idempotency guard so workflow reruns cannot double-publish.
- Scan before execution:
- Bash-loop generalization:
- One-liner:
- AsyncAdapter behaviour (5th first-class behaviour) + CitextProbe extraction: eliminates Task.Supervisor sandbox ownership leaks and citext OID flakes; PR-A foundation landed; PR-B advisory lane added; PR-C gate flip awaiting szTheory soak sign-off
- Credo step
- 1. [Rule 3 - Refactoring] Internal usage of `Message.new` migrated to `Message.build`
- Phase:
- Enforced v0.2 API stability via a CI script scanning for Swoosh type leaks and documented the official freeze policy.
- Phase:
- 1. [Rule 3 - Blocker] Fixed struct compile deadlock between Message and Stream
- RFC 8058 unsubscribe config, lifecycle seam, and Phoenix.Token URL service with raw-secret rotation fallback
- Message-aware outbound compliance now injects RFC 8058 unsubscribe headers atomically and strict lint blocks any ad hoc header mutation path.
- Core RFC 8058 unsubscribe controller with standalone GET confirmation, replay-safe POST event append, and lifecycle-aware transaction composition
- Added the core router macro for RFC 8058 unsubscribe routes, backed by compile-time collision detection and route reflection tests.
- Read-only `mix mailglass.gen.unsubscribe` checklist with strict CLI parsing, canonical router instructions, and live route-preflight guidance
- StreamData coverage now proves unsubscribe secret rotation, expiry, URL hardening, stream header gating, and one-click POST replay convergence.
- Adopter-facing RFC 8058 setup, replay, rotation, and DKIM verification guidance with load-bearing docs smoke coverage
- Webhook ingest now projects complaint, unsubscribe, and hard-bounce events into idempotent suppression rows through a centralized helper and replay-convergence property coverage
- A targeted Credo check now fails when webhook ingest moves suppression writes ahead of the durable event append and projector path
- Soft-bounce escalation now has an Oban-backed worker, a direct evaluation helper, and the V03 storage slot needed for its event-window query
- Tenant-scoped suppression rebuild via a shared resync service and strict `mix mailglass.suppressions.resync` contract
- Structured suppression preflight errors with reason/source/expiry context plus explicit non-PII telemetry for blocked sends and webhook auto-adds
- Tenant-scoped suppression removal now rejects complaint and unsubscribe rows, complaint expiries are blocked before insert and in Postgres, and the webhook guide documents why complaint suppression outlives deletable source evidence.
